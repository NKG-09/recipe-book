            <li>400g (14oz) pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt (for boiling pasta)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For tomato sauce</h3>

            <li>6 ripe tomatoes (or one 400g can of crushed tomatoes)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil (or 1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar (to balance acidity)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A handful of fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the pasta</h3>
                <ul><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions (usually around 9-11 minutes), until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving a small cup of pasta water for later.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Make the tomato sauce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If using fresh tomatoes, blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then remove the skins. Chop the tomatoes and set them aside. If using canned crushed tomatoes, you can skip this step.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes, until soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned crushed tomatoes) to the skillet, along with oregano, basil, sugar, and salt & pepper to taste. Stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Let the sauce simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Combine pasta and sauce</h3>
                <ul><li>Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat the pasta in the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Serve</h3>
                <ul><li>Plate the pasta and garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
